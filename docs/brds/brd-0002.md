# Business Requirements Document (BRD)
**Project Name:** P9G - Prepaid Package Business Model Expansion
**Version:** 1.0
**Prepared by:** Kyaw Ko Lwin
**Date:** 26/08/2025
**Stakeholders:** Management, Sales, Operations, IT Department

## 1. Executive Summary
The current prepaid package system is limited to a single customer per 90-day package. Market feedback from both direct customers and sales agents indicates a strong demand for a shared package model. This project aims to expand the business model by decoupling package ownership from usage, allowing a single package to be used by multiple end-customers. This will increase sales volume, attract agent networks, and improve customer satisfaction while introducing a robust tracking system to maintain financial integrity.

## 2. Project Background & Problem Statement
The original "90-day" prepaid package product was designed for individual use. However, customers frequently request to share these packages with family members. Furthermore, agents want to purchase packages in bulk and resell or allocate days to their own customers. The current system cannot track this shared usage, leading to:
*   Inability to tap into the agent-based sales channel.
*   Manual workarounds that are error-prone and untraceable.
*   Potential revenue loss from unmet market demand.
*   Lack of visibility into how a package's days are consumed.

## 3. Business Objectives
| Objective | Description | Success Metric |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Increase Revenue** | Capture new customer segments (groups, agents) by enabling package sharing. | 20% increase in prepaid package sales within 6 months of launch. |
| **Expand Channels** | Enable an agent network to sell and manage packages for their customers. | Onboard at least 10 active agents in the first quarter. |
| **Improve Traceability** | Accurately track the consumption of each package, regardless of how many people use it. | 100% of package usage is automatically tracked and recorded. |
| **Maintain Operational Integrity** | Ensure the new model does not create financial discrepancies or reporting issues. | Zero critical bugs related to usage calculation and billing. |

## 4. Scope
### 4.1 In-Scope
*   Creation of a new "Prepaid Package" entity separate from "Member."
*   Functionality to sell a package to a customer (individual or agent).
*   Functionality for users to apply a package's days to any reservation.
*   Automated deduction of days upon check-in.
*   Real-time visibility into a package's remaining balance.
*   Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update) operations for managing packages.

### 4.2 Out-of-Scope
*   Migrating historical data from the old member-based system.
*   A dedicated portal or dashboard for agents (v1).
*   Splitting or transferring days between packages.
*   Refund processing for used packages.
*   Advanced reporting and analytics dashboards (v1).

## 5. High-Level Business Requirements
1.  **HLR-01:** The system must allow the creation of a prepaid package, owned by a purchaser, containing a fixed number of days.
2.  **HLR-02:** The system must allow any reservation to be linked to a prepaid package via a unique package identifier.
3.  **HLR-03:** The system must automatically deduct the number of nights stayed from the linked package's balance upon guest check-in.
4.  **HLR-04:** The system must prevent the use of a package if the remaining balance is insufficient for the intended reservation.
5.  **HLR-05:** Users must be able to view the current balance and transaction history for any prepaid package.
