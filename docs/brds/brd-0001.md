## 1. Purpose
Purpose of this document is to present the business requirements and concens about the new development of member/prepaid management module.

## 2. Description
This document defines the business requirements for the new development of member management module. The main objective is to sell the "Prepaid Packages" to the customers. The original package is "90 days" and intended to sell to and used by a single customer. But according to the customers' requests, the package is allowed to used by any number of customers. Originally, the package is equally divided into two as "45 days" and used by two customers. Later agents want to buy the package and used for their customers as well. Therefore it is not possible to trace the usage by the customer, it is advised to trace the package usage by the package ID itself, just like a Member ID but it is better to call it Prepaid Card ID or Prepaid ID.
